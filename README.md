# FPV_Australia

This site is for recreational FPV drone pilots flying race or freestyle machines.

The [https://github.com/ctzsnooze/FPV_Australia/wiki](wiki) contains links to the relevant legislation.

FPV enthusiasts in Australia face a range of Government related regulations, many of which were written before light-weight FPV quadcopter technology existed.  Many of these regulations are inappropriate for what we do.

Agencies like CASA and ACMA are required to provide regulations to ensure the safe physcial and radio environment for all users.  We benefit from their regulations; a space exists for us in their view of the world.  However, the explosion in modern technology poses significant regulatory challenges for any regulatory body, and many of their regulations appear excessively restrictive and bluntly designed.

This repository is intended to provide a means for  Australian sport FPV pilots to create a draft a set of guidelines that, if adhered to, more effectively balance the safety aspects against the technical requirements of our sport.

Hopefully the diverse Australian FPV community can join in this process.  If our guidelines are well respected and sensible, those who fly under them will fly safely, avoiding accidents and bad publicity.  

If we can't agree on suitable guidelines, the Government will do whatever it likes.  Having a set of well-defined guidelines with a proven safe track record may induce CASA and ACMA to co-operatively work together in future policy development.
