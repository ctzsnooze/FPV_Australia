# FPV_Australia

This is a site for recreational race or freestyle FPV drone pilots.  It is not for commercial drone pilots.

For file and site links, please see the [wiki](https://github.com/ctzsnooze/FPV_Australia/wiki/Contents).

## Introduction

Recreational drone pilots in Australia have significant restrictions on when where we can fly.  

The regulations are intended to ensure the safety of other airspace users, and other people or property.  There are significant penalties for non-compliance.

Many of us feel that the FPV restrictions are unreasonable.  LOS restrictions are much less onerous.

This site focuses on how race/freestyle FPV pilots could, as a group, work positively for change, explaining the legislation and the exemption process.

## Current restrictions on FPV

The simple act of flying FPV, other than at an CASA FPV-approved location (such as a club field), or indoors, is currently not permitted.

This absolute restriction on FPV, as opposed to LOS, applies regardless of the size of the drone, or how low you fly, or whether or not what you did was safe.  

The fine is 5 penalty units ($1,110); if contested in court, the maximum penalty that can be imposed by the Judge is up to 50 units, or $11,100. 

FPV flying a 70g whoop outdoors, at knee height, FPV, on your own property, risks the full $1,110 fine; in contrast, it is perfectly legal to fly a 2kg drone LOS, and up to 400 feet in the air.  We all know which is more potentially hazardous.

## Exemptions to the anti-FPV rules

CASA can approve exemptions to the legislated regulations, incuding exemptions that permit FPV.  CASA's purpose is airspace safety.  Provided that the requested exemption checks out from a safety and risk analysis, CASA should not unreasonably refuse it 

Currently, FPV exemptions have been granted only at specific locations, for a certain class of drone, and for a restricted group of pilots, and under certain conditions (eg compliance with a spefified set of procedures).  

This is how Club fields have gained permission for their members fly FPV at their fields.  Their exemptions are restricted to the specified field only, and nowhere else.

## Can we apply individually or as a small group for FPV of a local field?

Yes.  The process is complex.  In principle, getting formal approval to fly FPV someone's farm, or to fly FPV at a local park, is no different from that undertaken by a club.  

I will provide more information on how to do this here as soon as I can.

## Why would we bother to get approval just to fly at a local field, or a friend's private rural property?

If you have FPV approval for a local park, or a rural farm proprty, then you can share an FPV video from there without risk of being fined - assuming you flew in full compliance with the general model aircraft safety rules as well as the additional specific conditions of the exemption.  

## Can we apply for an exemption to make FPV 'legal' generally, i.e. anywhere we could otherwise fly a drone LOS?

A broad, general exemption permitting FPV would only be considered for specific conditions that maintained an adequate level of airspace and personal safety.

Regrettably, being illegal makes it very difficult to prove safety.  Even though many of us fly hundreds of hours a year FPV very safely, admitting to that is self-incriminating.  Without a 'moratorium' of some kind, so that a non-incriminating data collection process could take place, the true safety profile of of FPV flying cannot be ascertained by anyone.  CASA will only get complaints and hear of occasional incidents, but not have a clue about the denominator, or how many hours are flown safely, to put those events into perspective.  And we won't know if the incidents come from 'sensible' pilots or first day beginners with no clue.  

From CASA's perspective, the current anti-FPV provisions must apply to all model aircraft and UAVs, including Mavics and Phantoms (which can have the camera pointed straight down and hover a long time like that), long-range flying massively beyone line of sight, including long-range fixed wing model aircraft with narrow forward angle cameras, heavy model aircraft (drones or helicopters) to 25kg, and drones that could perform autonomous flyaways or indefinite flight if the Rx or Video link is lost.

Given the massive variety of risk scenarios, some of which are obviously concerning, it's not surprising that CASA has adopted a restrictive approach.  

CASA has indicated that it requires the model aircraft pilots themselves to argue that FPV is safe under certain conditions.  It has published the means by which exemption requests can be generated.  The MAAA and AMAS have been successful in gaining exemptions generally and at specific fields, but CASA can make FPV exemptions for your own personal farm or property, at specific defined public spaces, and even general exemptions for certain types of drones (subject to agreed conditions).

It is up to us to do the leg work and make these requests.

In every case, we have to go through a specific process that requires a thorough risk analysis, risk control process, procedure documentation etc.

Templates for applications of this kind currently don't exist; this site is intended to be a place where they can be created and shared.

Any general FPV application would apply to a specific class of drone, a specific set of conditions, and perhaps a particular set of pilots.

CASA only ever approves exemptions for a limited period of time.  Every exemption would be subject to review; at the very least, each initial exemption could be considered a 'trial period' that would allow data collection on safety.

## An application to permit FPV flying of whoops would be the simplest first step.

For instance, we could apply for an exemption to the FPV restriction for whoops, being fixed-camera, protected-prop, whoop type drones, under 100g, flown under 100 feet AGL.  

For example, we note, in the risk analysis, that:
- with such very low mass, and with enclosed props, and the relatively low maximum speed, the maximum impact energy is well below that of a firmly struck cricket ball, soccer ball, frisbee or other common recreational toy.  Hence the risk of injury to person or property is so low as to be irrelevant, in a practical sense.
- low mass and the very low maximum altitude restriction greatly reduces the risk to other airspace users; risk of damge from impact is far less than that of a 1kg bat or 250g bird, for instance
- The risk of error flying FPV is less than LOS anyway due to lack of spatial cues when flying LOS with such a small drone
- by not permitting autonomous flight, flyaways are unlikely
- by having FPV specific checks and procedures, the safety of FPV greatly enhanced over not having defined procedures
- The noise of the drone is far less than of larger drones.
- The risk of fire from a tiny drone is miniscule since the impact energy is insufficient to breach the lipo and the heat to surface area ratio of these tiny lipos is very low.

The application could include videos of impacts of whoops vs various objects, compared to cricket balls and the like, and demonstrate sufficient visibility at night.

We may end up with this set of restrictions, perhaps:

The drone itself:
- AUW < 100g
- FPV camera physcially fixed (no gimbal), must point forward, and must not point downward
- prop tips must be enclosed so they cannot cause skin laceration on impact
- autonomous flight not permitted (eg, no auto return to home, no auto manouevres)
- automatic full motor disarm after loss of Rx for 1s or longer
- battery voltage and Rx signal strenght indication, with alarm, in the OSD

The flight procedures will be compliant with all relevant general safety provisions, except that:
- additional FPV specific pre-flight safety checks and procedures as set out in the application must be followed
- must not fly above 100 feet AGL
- no spotter is required (due to trivial risk of impact with other persons, and the overall low risk of such events)
- separation from other people/proprty of 5m (not 30m) since is intrinsically far less hazardous than much larger drones even at 30m.
- may be flown at night provided that the area and the drone are illuminated well enough that the pilot's FPV view is as good as daylight, and the drone can be by other people at least as well as in daylight.

The process for such an application is described here (link soon).

# What about model aircraft registration and model aircraft pilot licensing? - It's coming, likely March 2022...

This is a significant change, with pluses and minuses.  It's a way off yet.  People who fly exclusively at club fields won't be affected as much.

On the plus side, assuning strong compliance:
- CASA get a clearer idea how many of us there are, how many drones are out there
- if CASA know how many hours we fly, they can assess our relative safety profile per hour flown
- if we lose a drone, and it has ID on it, we might get it back if someone finds it
- CASA can have a mailing list for model aircraft / drone pilots, keeping us up to date on incidents and policy changes
- CASA perceive that if a pilot repeatedly breaches regulations, their licence could be canceled, and that this will stop the pilot flying

On the downside:
- the penalties for non-registration can cost a lot of money - even if the flying itself was perfectly safe
- if we fly outside the regulations, or have a mishap, for which we might have otherwise avoided identification, ID on the drone could identify us.
- CASA could terminate our pilot licence
- we may get fined for accidental non-compliance, even though we really tried hard to comply
- these processes will take time and will cost money
- some of us have a lot of drones to register and label
- a generic sticker with your pilot ID, which could be printed out and the same one put on each drone, isn't acceptable  
- labelling very small drones each with it's own ID sticker will be difficult; there's not a lot of space on a 250g drone
- if the label falls off, or becomes illegible, you're potentially in trouble
- if the registration is time limited and you forget to 'renew', you're potentially in trouble
- there's that general feeling that this is all to authoritarian and unnecessary
- there's a concern that all kinds of additional compliance requirements will gradually be added

 
## Pilot licencing

In the near future, all recreational model aircraft pilots will need to be licenced.  

Its likely that to be licenced to fly a drone, an online regulation knowledge test will be required.  The cost of the licence is not known.

Flying any model aircraft over 250g, other than a glider, while unlicenced, may result in a 5 unit, $1,110 fine - up to 50 units max, or $11,100 if contested.  

## Drone registration

From about the same time, all recreational drones over 250g will also need to be individually registered.  

This will be an on-line process.  The cost to register each drone is not currently known.  The registration number must be applied to the drone.

Failure to register a drone carries the same 5->50 unit, $1,110 fine; up to $11,100 if contested.  

Failure to provide registration documentation for a drone when requested carries a different penalty, which may be $110 or $1,110 if contested, it's not entirely clear to me; the maximum is 5 units, but the minimum may be 1 unit or $220, I dont know if they can do half unit fines.

There may be exemptions for model aircraft that are only flown at registered Club fields and nowhere else.
